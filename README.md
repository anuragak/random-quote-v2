An awesome, but not quite random, quote project!

A quote is chosen from an array of 10 quotes, to be displayed on the screen whenever the user clicks the show another quote button or when 30 seconds pass. The same quote will not appear twice in a row, leading to it's not quite random functionality. Below is a link to the result of the code, hope you enjoy!
